# Project Summary: Loan Risk Assessment & Approval Modeling

I worked on a synthetic dataset for loan risk assessment and approval prediction to simulate how financial institutions evaluate loan applicants.

## Steps Taken

**1. Data Cleaning:** Standardized missing values, normalized categorical fields (e.g., employment status, loan approval), and ensured numeric consistency for risk scores.

**2. SQL Analysis:** [*sql-query-file*]

* Segmented borrowers into risk deciles (1–10).

* Calculated approval rates by decile to identify risk–approval trends.

* Validated insights through aggregate queries (approval %, loan counts).

**3. Visualization in Tableau:** [*Visualization:*]

* Built an interactive dashboard titled "Loan Risk & Approval Analysis".

* Added KPI cards (Total Applicants, Approval Rate, Avg Risk Score of Approved Loans, High-Risk Approval %).

**4. Designed charts:**

* Approval Rate by Risk Decile (clear risk–approval trend).

* Approval Rate by Employment Status.

* Loan Distribution across Age & Income Groups.

* Used color-coding to highlight low vs. high-risk categories.

## Key Insights

* Higher risk deciles showed significantly lower approval rates, validating expected risk–reward tradeoffs.

* Employment stability was strongly correlated with approval likelihood.

* Among approved loans, the average risk score clustered in mid-risk ranges, showing cautious lender behavior.

## Value of the Project

This project demonstrates how SQL + Tableau can be combined to simulate real-world loan approval processes, providing decision-makers with a data-driven view of credit risk.
